# 🧠 AI Algorithms

A curated collection of AI-first trading and analysis tools, agents, and algorithmic logic. Built to explore the intersection of markets, machine learning, automation, and alpha.

## ⚙️ Overview

This repo is a live R\&D space for building and experimenting with AI-native trading algorithms. It includes:

* Quant strategies (rule-based and learning-based)
* AI agent logic for automation and signal generation
* Tools for market structure analysis
* Experimental scripts and notebooks for futures, forex, crypto, and equities

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a sandbox project for research and prototyping. Use at your own risk.


## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo evolves continuously. Some code may be experimental, partially functional, or intentionally left incomplete for testing or prompt engineering purposes.

If you’re looking for:

* Fully integrated bots or automated trading flows → check my n8n workflows or reach out.
* High-performance, production-ready systems → coming soon in Quantra Lab’s private repo.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TA-Lib)
* OpenAI API & Langchain (for intelligent agents)
* TradingView-compatible indicators & signals
* Jupyter, JSON, YAML for workflows and prompts
* Integration-ready with n8n, MT5/MT4, ByBit, TwelveData, and more


## 🔮 Vision

> Build the future of trading with AI-first tools, not lagging indicators.
> Alpha isn’t found — it’s engineered.
